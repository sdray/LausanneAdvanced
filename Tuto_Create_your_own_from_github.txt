* Create a new repository on github

* Go to the terminal and navigate to the local directory with the existing project (courseSkeleton)
Now in the terminal type: 

	git push git@github.com:sdray/INSAcourse.git +main:main
where 
	"master" - is the master branch in the new repository
	"old-repo-branch"  is the branch that you want to use. In my case it was a master branch, so my command was +master:master

* That's it! Now you can go ahead and clone it to your local folder. (create from existing in Rstudio)

* Change the name of the Rproj and replace occurrences of the project name (Readme files).
